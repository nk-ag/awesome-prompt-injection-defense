# Awesome Prompt Injection Defense [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools, papers, datasets, and resources for defending Large Language Models against prompt injection and indirect prompt injection attacks.

Prompt injection is the leading security risk in production LLM systems. The defense ecosystem is fragmented across academic preprints, vendor blogs, npm/PyPI utilities, and ad-hoc system prompts. This list is an attempt to bring it together in one place.

## Detection libraries

Drop-in checks you call before passing untrusted text to an LLM.

- [prompt-injection-shield](https://github.com/MukundaKatta/prompt-injection-shield) (npm) - Zero-dep detector for classic override, URL exfiltration, system-prompt impersonation, and tool-call hijack patterns.
- [prompt-injection-shield-py](https://pypi.org/project/prompt-injection-shield-py/) (PyPI) - Python port of the above with the same rule set.
- [Rebuff](https://github.com/protectai/rebuff) - Self-hardening prompt injection detector, originally by ProtectAI.
- [LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) - Comprehensive LLM input/output security suite, includes prompt injection scanner.
- [PromptArmor](https://github.com/promptarmor/promptarmor) - Hosted prompt injection detection API.
- [Lakera Guard](https://www.lakera.ai/lakera-guard) - Commercial guardrail with a generous free tier.

## RAG-specific guardrails

Prompt injection in RAG often hides inside retrieved documents (indirect injection) or poisoned vectors.

- [vector-poison-score](https://github.com/MukundaKatta/vector-poison-score) (npm) / [vector-poison-score-py](https://pypi.org/project/vector-poison-score-py/) (PyPI) - Heuristic score for whether a retrieved chunk has been poisoned.
- [rag-guardrails-action](https://github.com/MukundaKatta/rag-guardrails-action) - GitHub Action that runs both detectors over a fixtures directory in CI.
- [LangChain Guardrails](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guardrails/) - Built-in chain-of-trust patterns for LangChain-based RAG.
- [LlamaIndex SafetyToolkit](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/evaluating/) - Evaluation hooks usable as guardrails.

## Evaluation datasets

Labeled corpora for benchmarking detectors.

- [prompt-injection-eval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mukunda1729/prompt-injection-eval) - 74 hand-curated rows across 9 categories (classic override, URL exfil, system impersonation, tool hijack, role override, encoded, indirect RAG poison, borderline, benign). MIT.
- [deepset/prompt-injections](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepset/prompt-injections) - Larger English/German prompt injection corpus.
- [JailbreakBench](https://github.com/JailbreakBench/jailbreakbench) - Standardised benchmark for jailbreaks (related but broader category).
- [Lakera Gandalf prompts](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) - Real attack prompts collected from the Gandalf game.

## Live demos

Try detectors in the browser.

- [Prompt Injection Shield Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mukunda1729/prompt-injection-shield-demo) - Streamlit app on Hugging Face Spaces, paste a passage and see severity-scored hits.
- [Lakera Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) - Interactive game for designing prompts that bypass guardrails.

## GitHub Actions for CI

Plug into pull-request flows.

- [rag-guardrails-action](https://github.com/MukundaKatta/rag-guardrails-action) - Composite Action wrapping prompt-injection-shield + vector-poison-score. Fail on high severity, warn on medium.

## Contributing

Send a pull request. Each entry should:
1. Already exist (no vaporware or roadmaps).
2. Be free or have a meaningful free tier.
3. Have a one-line description of what makes it useful, not just a name.

Sort within each section alphabetically, except where the order is meaningful.
